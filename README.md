# Portfolio
This repository contains a portfolio of my selected projects in data science and machine learning areas.


## Regression
  - ### Price Prediction
  	- [Price prediction of used cars based on multiple numerical and categorical parameters](https://github.com/aghelinejad/Data-Science/tree/master/Regression/Used%20Cars): Built predictor models with object-oriented programming in Python. Performed EDA, data visualization, data cleaning, feature engineering and feature selection, applied three regression models, used cross-validation for model selection, tuned the best model, and created predictions for test data set (The dataset was provided from kaggle website)

## Classification
  - ### Fraud Detection
	- [Built a classifier model for detecting fraudulent transactions of a bank's customers](https://github.com/aghelinejad/Data-Science/blob/master/Classification/Fraud_detection): Utilized different techniques(i.e., oversampling, undersampling, class_weight parameter) to prepare the imbalanced dataset for modeling, applied four classification models, selected best model and best preprocessing approach through cross-validation, applied grid-search to optimize the final model (The dataset was provided from kaggle website)

## Clustering
  - ### Customer Segmentation
	- [Geodemographic segmentation of a mall's customers(Udemy)](https://github.com/aghelinejad/Data-Science/tree/master/Clustering/Customer-Segmentation): Used k-means and hierarchical clustering algorithms for modeling, used "within cluster sum of squares" and dendrogram to find optimal number of clusters, visualized the results in a 2D graph

## Natural Language Processong (NLP)
  - ### Segmentation of Online Reviews
	- [Segmentation of a company’s online reviews to effectively improve their quality of product(Udemy)](https://github.com/aghelinejad/Data-Science/tree/master/NLP/Online-Reviews): Performed NLP modeling using “bag of words” technique in combination with different classification algorithms, used multiple text cleaning methods to preprocess the data
