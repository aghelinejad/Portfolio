# Portfolio
This repository contains a portfolio of my selected projects in data science and machine learning areas.

## Regression
  - ### Price Prediction
  	- [Price prediction of used cars in India](https://github.com/aghelinejad/Data-Science/tree/master/Regression/Used%20Cars): Built predictor models with object-oriented programming in Python. Performed EDA, data visualization, data cleaning, feature engineering and feature selection, applied three regression models, used cross-validation for model selection, tuned the best model, and created predictions for test data set (The dataset was provided from kaggle website)
	
  - ### Price Prediction
  	- [Predicting the crew size of cruise ships](https://github.com/aghelinejad/Data-Science/tree/master/Regression/Cruise-Ships): Developed regression models for predicting the crew size of cruise ships based on multiple variables. The predictive features were carefully selected by checking their correlation strength with the target variable, and the selected model was effectively tuned. The regularization effects on the models’ performances were thoroughly investigated by tracking the changes in error metrics and in the Pearson correlation coefficient. 

## Classification
  - ### Fraud Detection
	- [Detecting fraudulent transactions of a bank's customers](https://github.com/aghelinejad/Data-Science/blob/master/Classification/Fraud_detection): Created binary classifier models for fraud detection in a bank's transactions. Utilized different techniques(i.e., oversampling, undersampling, applying class_weight parameter) to prepare the imbalanced dataset for modeling, selected and tuned the best model among 4 classifiers along with best preprocessing approach using cross-validation and grid-search techniques (The dataset was provided from kaggle website)

## Natural Language Processong (NLP)
  - ### Segmentation of Online Reviews
	- [Segmentation of a company’s online reviews on their quality of product(Udemy)](https://github.com/aghelinejad/Data-Science/tree/master/NLP/Online-Reviews): Performed NLP modeling using “bag of words” technique in combination with different classification algorithms, used multiple text cleaning methods to preprocess the data
